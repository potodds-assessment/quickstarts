# Integrating Data
## Test

* [Integrating Data](https://spring.io/guides/gs/integration/)

For this guideâ€™s sample application, you will define a Spring Integration flow that:
Reads blog posts from the RSS feed at spring.io.
Transforms them into an easily readable String consisting of the post title and the URL for the post.
Appends that String to the end of a file (/tmp/si/SpringBlog).
